# Twitter-Sentiment-Anaysis
This is a collection of scripts that use machine learning algorithms to evaluate sentiment from twitter data. 
The data file is a subset of my complete dataset due to the file size limitations of GitHub.
The full dataset has about 200000 entries.

vec_regrssion_models can use either of the two files as inputs for training. 
This script uses vector represesntions of tweets to trian.

6_ngrams_classifier takes in text data rather than vectors and this data is too large to put online.
